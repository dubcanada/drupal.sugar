## About ##

It provides code sense and snippets for the Drupal API making a Drupal dev's life that much easier.

This sugar is under (semi-)active development. Currently supported are:

- autocomplete of most API functions
- autocomplete of most common Drupal variables
- lookup
- form api snippets

- Unzip
- Double click

Espresso will launch and install the sugar.

1. Download the source (make sure everything is packaged in a folder called Drupal.sugar and double click the package).
2. Clone the project to the folder ~Library/Application Support/Espresso/Sugars/Drupal.sugar This way you can pull in the latest changes.


## Usage ##

Code sense will trigger for all Drupal documents (when looking at a document you can check this via the menu View > Language. Drupal PHP should be selected.)

When a Drupal document is active the actions dropdown will have an item Drupal. You can access snippets and actions throught this menu item.

### Form snippets ###

In the Drupal actions menu you will find al list of snippets for the most common form elements. Each snippet has a text trigger.

    textfield + TAB will expand to a $form['key'] = array(); with textfield data.
    
There is also a blank template for other elements

    blank + TAB
    
    
Form item properties also have custom triggers, but these are hidden from the menu.

    #value + TAB will expand to '#value' => '',
    #submit + TAB will expand to '#submit' => array(),
    

### Lookup ###

You can quickly lookup code in you default browser with the following shortcuts:

1. **command shift d** will search for the selected text on drupal.org
2. **command shift a** will serach for the selected text on api.drupal.org

If no text is selected you will go to each respetive homepage.
